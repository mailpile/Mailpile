# Executive summary

The script `repackage-linux.sh` can rebuild the Mailpile installer for
Windows when run on Gnu-Linux. Run it, yay!

repackage-linux.sh [--local] [<branch>]

 --local causes the Mailpile code that is packaged to be cloned from the local
        git repository from which the repackage-linux.sh script was checked
        out. Default is to clone from https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile.git.
        
 <branch> is the branch of the Mailpile git repository that will be checked out.
        The default is "master".

# Windows details

When run, the installer creates a start menu section Mailpile with entries
     Open Mailpile
     Start Mailpile
     Uninstall Mailpile
     
When Mailpile is run, it creates a System Tray icon. Right-clicking on that
icon pops up a menu with entries
    Open Mailpile
    Donate
    Debug
    Quit

# What it builds and where

It builds the Windows installer in /tmp/mailpile-winbuild. In addition, the
installed image, a collection of source archive files and (if third party
packages are rebuilt) the build directories for the third party packages are
left in /tmp/mailpile-winbuild.

The specific archives to be used in building the installer are configured by
shell variable settings at the beginning of the script. As new versions of
third party packages are released by the upstream developers, these can be
modified (or not) as required.

A complete build takes 15 minutes on my 2011 vintage AMD 8 core 2.8 GHz system.

# Mailpile code

The Mailpile code is checked out from either the local repository or github.

# Python

The Python Windows (.msi) installer and package files for all needed Python 
modules are downloaded from python.org to PythonDistFiles in the local git
working copy, then PythonDistFiles is copied to the install image. The Python
installer and pip are run on the target Windows computer to install all the
needed Python code. Subsequent builds in the same git working copy use the 
already downloaded files.

    Caution: The file requirements-with-deps.txt must list all the Python
            packages that will be required including indirect dependencies. 
            That file must be committed - the version used is the one checked 
            out from the repository.
            
    Note: After installing on Windows, check the file 
            C:\Program Files (x86)\Mailpile ehf\Mailpile\Python27\check.txt .
            to determine if any dependencies are missing. Also the pip log
            can be checked if there are problems. It is saved at
            C:\Program Files (x86)\Mailpile ehf\Mailpile\Python27\install.txt .
            
# Other third party packages

Third party packages (e.g. GnuPG, OpenSSL) are built from source archives
downloaded from each project's home web site to SourceArchive in the local git
working copy, using the unique build system of each project. The packages are
built in subdirectories of /tmp/mailpile-winbuild. Once built, needed files are
copied to subdirectories of the script directory (e.g. packages/windows/GnuPG).
Those subdirectories are then copied to the install image. The SourceArchive
directory is copied to /tmp/mailpile-winbuild so that all the source is
available to publish for licence compliance purposes.

Subsequent builds will use the needed files stored in the script directory so
avoid unnecessary rebuilding of the third party packages.

An archive of the Mailpile code image, identified by its commit id, is also 
saved in /tmp/mailpile-winbuild/SourceArchive.

The MailpileLauncher package is downloaded in binary form from
https://www.mailpile.is/files/build/MailpileLauncher.zip
It appears to require MS Visual Studio to build. Possibly in the future
a free version could be substituted.

# File integrity

Some downloaded files are checked for integrity against checksums hardcoded
into the script. This includes the Python installer, GnuPG and OpenPG.
