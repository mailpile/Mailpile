# Welcome to Mailpile! #

## Introduction ##

Mailpile (<https://www.mailpile.is/>) is a modern, fast web-mail client
with user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of
Mailpile is funded by
[a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)
and all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI
approved Free Software license.

Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user
interface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to
make it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed
e-mail.

Mailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic
command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology
for the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop
application (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a
remote web-mail on a personal server or VPS.

The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal
with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine
allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and
the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail
either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.

**Note:** We are currently "in beta", which means the app's basic
features are (mostly) in place and packages are available for popular
operating systems, for people who would like to help test and debug.

We have live demos up and running [on our
website](https://www.mailpile.is/demos/). If you are curious about what
Mailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out.


### Installing Mailpile

Note that Mailpile is still in development and is not suitable for
production or end-user use. However, developers and early adopters are
encouraged to give it a try and even help us find bugs, fix them and
develop new features.

## Credits and License ##

Bjarni R. Einarsson (<http://bre.klaki.net/>) created this!  If you think
it's neat, you should also check out PageKite: <https://pagekite.net/>.
At some point Bjarni, that crafty fellow, convinced
[Smári](<http://www.smarimccarthy.is/>) and
[Brennan](https://brennannovak.com) to start working on the project as
well.

The GMail guys get mad props for creating the best webmail service out
there. Wishing the Free Software world had something like it is what
inspired Bjarni to start working on Mailpile. Edward Snowden also gets
mad props for inspiring us to try and make PGP usable for journalists
and everday folks!
